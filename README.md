# travel-form

You just started your own airline, and you need to create a form to collect data about your passengers' upcoming travel plans so they can book their flight.

You should collect the following information from the user:

-[] First name (text input)
-[] Last name (text input)
-[] Age (number input)
-[] Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options)
-[] Location traveling to (select box with at least 3 options. You're an airline that doesn't fly to many places.)
-[] Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes for vegetarian, kosher, lactose free, ect. Include at least 3 options)

Each element of the form should be given a "name" attribute so you can access the data in JavaScript and do stuff with it.

There should also be a button at the end of the form to submit it. Upon pressing the button, an alert should pop up that looks like this:

Style the form to be user friendly and welcoming.
